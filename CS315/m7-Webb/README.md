## Student: Jeremiah Webb

### Description
Small program to demonstrate the functionality and use of a linear probing hash table.
Reads from an input.txt file and uses the words as a key and the amount of occurances of the word as its value. After successfuly inputting and hashing all words the program will go on to iterate through the all the hash tables keys.

### Known Issues
Unchecked type casts when creating the hash class, due to the use of generics

### Compilation & Running
javac Queue.java
javac InputReader.java
javac WordCounter.java
java WordCounter.java
